# buskit-server
Backend server for the live music streaming application Buskit

## Prereqs

1. Install MongoDB and start server (`$ mongod`)
2. Install NodeJS (with npm)
3. Install yarn (`$ npm i -g yarn`)
4. Clone the repo and `$ cd` into it
5. `$ yarn` to install dependencies

## Spinning up the server
1. `$ yarn start` to start the web server on `http://localhost:3000/`

## Authentication
Buskit secures protected endpoints with [JWTs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-jwt) (read the section *Include the JWT in requests*). A user can retrieve their JWT by authenticating with Twith. Currently only the [*OAuth Authorization Code Flow*](
https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/getting-tokens-oauth/#oauth-authorization-code-flow
) is supported which requires a client to send an *Authorization Code* to the auth endpoint on the Buskit server. Upon receiving an auth code, the server will verify the code with Twitch, find or create a user in the Buskit database, and finally respond with relevant user info (including a JWT).
